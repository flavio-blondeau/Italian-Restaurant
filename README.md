## Italian Restaurant WebPage

*Work in progress...*

This is a small project for refreshing some Django skills.

It is a webpage of an italian restaurant with a clickable menu,
where we can see a dish more specifically.

Using admin part, you can add or modify dishes, and you are
also able to mark one dish as unavailable.

There is also a QR code for easy accessibility.
